    <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility —
        as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
        You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd
        like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
        intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefit of (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding
            30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases
            (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> &gt; 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
          <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">
            CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as
            300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in
            a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
          <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
          <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used
            to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on
            the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements.
            One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
            modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
          <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
          <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
            believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",
            stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
            Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because
            they were really cold.</dd>
